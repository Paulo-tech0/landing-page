# landing-page
This project consists of a landing page for finishing the odin project flexbox section in the foundations.

The goal is to replicate their example landing page as best as possible, which will be my goal here.

I will be commiting to show not only how i approached the problem, but so that i can get back to the previous states of the project, as i think that i will be doing a lot of errors until i get it down.
